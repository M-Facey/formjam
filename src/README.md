# FormJAM SRC

This is for explaining how the project is organized based on the folders. Some of the folders will have further documentation if I think it is necessary, otherwise, you can just navigate to the folder by click its name in the table beyond and check out the code.

## Folder Structure

So, here is a table to give you an basic run-down of what is in each folder.
