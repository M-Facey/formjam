# FormJam: A Simple Form App

This is a simple app created using Vue 3 and Pocketbase. The `src` documentation found [here](./src/README.md) can help newcomers understand how the project is broken down based on folder structure. :warning: The docs for different folders are still being worked on.

## :computer: The Tech I Used

### Front end

- Vue 3 with Typescript
  - Vue Router: for routing
- Tiptap for rich text editor
  - Character Count plugin
  - Link plugin
  - Underline plugin
- Icones for icons
- TailwindCSS

### Back end

- Pocketbase (v0.18.9)

```

### Run dev mode

```sh
pnpm dev
```

### Type-check and run build for production
